## Things about me ✨

So from what I said, I'm José Plinio, a 16 year old young man who wants to work in the IT area. I've been interested in technology for a long time and my first steps were tinkering with pieces of hardware like motherboards, video cards and others, so after I discovered programming I was fascinated by the things that could be created and using programming, and seeing this I was interested in the area and focused on entering this area for the salary and the freedom I can have and other reasons, which in any case were part of my story.
